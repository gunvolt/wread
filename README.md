## wread
Simple "read-from-web" cli tool.
To install, rename wread.py to wread and copy to a directory recognized by your path. Python will compile it on runtime for you. 
Depends on Python 2 and is available on Mac, Linux, BSD, and similar UNIXes (cygwin/winbash required for windows).
Usage: wread -u (url).
If you just type wread it will go to wikipedia's random page.
